## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I gained more understanding about max-width and min-width and how useful they are in developing responsive website pages. I also learned to import/use a local font. I also learned to about 'fit-content'. And I also learned how to deploy site using netlify.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.card {
    max-width: 300px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 8px 8px hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
    transition: box-shadow .5s;
}
.learning {
    background-color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    font-weight: bold;
    width: fit-content;
    padding: 5px 10px 5px;
    border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about transitions, transforms and generally on how to create animations.
